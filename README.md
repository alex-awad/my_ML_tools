# my_ML_tools

## Outline

Python package that facilitates common operations in Machine Learning workflow
with "classical" Machine Learning models. Currently only works for regression 
problems. 

This package includes DataTools to import and pre-process data, PlotTools for 
exploratory data analysis and evaluation of the results form the trained models,
and ModelTools for automatic training, tuning, and evaluation of different 
Machine Learning models.

Currently implemented models: 
- Lasso regression (scikit-learn)
- Ridge regression (scikit-learn)
- Random Forest regression (scikit-learn) 
- SVM regression (scikit-learn)
- GBM regression (XGBoost)
- Multilayer Perceptron regression (Keras)
